# Qsys_modules
A collection of modules/plugins I've made in the past for the Q-sys DSP platform by QSC.  
## Kinda useful things
### Testy
The most complete test bench I've seen for Q-sys.  Contains a pair of audio injectors, a probe, routeable controls and three patch cables.  
### Call in Chime
Plays a audio chime when someone calls in.  Used mostly in situastions when the client wants a cheap paging system
## Time savers
### Mono sum
Preconfigured mixer to sum a stereo signal to mono
### Mute button
Preconfigured mute button
