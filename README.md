# Qsys_modules
A collection of modules/plugins I've made in the past for the Q-sys DSP platform by QSC.  
## How to use
click the green "download code" button on the top right of the page, then click "download zip" and unzip the contents of that folder to your "QSC\Q-Sys Designer\User Components" folder.  
## Kinda useful things
### Testy
The most complete test bench I've seen for Q-sys.  Contains a pair of audio injectors, a probe, routeable controls and three patch cables.

## Time savers

Preconfigured mixer to sum a stereo signal to mono
### Mute button
Preconfigured mute button
